\chapter{Qt framework structure}\label{section:qtstructure}
Qt framework itself is a huge software collection and needs to be divided into logical units. Two main units are \textit{libraries} and \textit{additional software}.

Additional software includes compilers, tools for internationalization and tens of other tools. Some of them will be described in \autoref{section:compilation}.

Qt offers very rich and diverse functionality (see \autoref{section:components}), ranging from network communication to painting vector pictures.

This chapter introduces some basic concepts of Qt: \textit{modules} and \textit{tree-like} structure.

\section{Modules}
Each unit of related functionality is called \textit{module}\index{module}. Module is set of classes which is contained within a single (static or dynamic, see \autoref{section:compilation}) library file. If you want to use this module in your code, you have to include appropriate header files and link your binary against the library file. Higher number of used modules results in more linked libraries and (possibly) bigger output binaries. Choice of Qt modules for application programming is therefore important.

\subsection{Linking}\label{listing:linking}
Each module usually depends on QtCore\index{QtCore} module, including QtWidgets module. QtWidgets module is used for building classical widget-based \fdocabbrevref{GUI}s. Moreover, QtWidgets module depends on QtGui module. QtGui module contains  So each Qt-based application with user interface has to be linked against at least three modules.

Consider elementary \fdocabbrevref{GUI} application with main window. You can find source in\fdocinlinecode{text}{!}{sources/laboratory/04-guiapp} subdirectory. Application is compiled with modules QtCore and QtWidgets. You can use GNU \textit{ldd}\index{ldd} application to list all dynamic libraries required for running the executable file. Output for our sample application looks very similar to the on in \autoref{listing:ldd}.

Pay attention to lines \ref{listing:qt5w}--\ref{listing:qt5c}. Typical program with user interface needs to be linked against QtCore, QtGui and QtWidgets. Console applications need just QtCore. You can list unused (but linked) libraries too as seen in \autoref{listing:ldd2}.

\begin{fdoccode}{text}{listing:ldd2}{Unused (but linked) libraries for \fdocabbrevref{GUI} application}
[root@arch-linux 04-guiapp]# ldd -d -r -u 04-guiapp
Unused direct dependencies:
/opt/qt5/5.0.0/gcc/lib/libQt5Gui.so.5
/usr/lib/libGL.so.1
/usr/lib/libpthread.so.0
/usr/lib/libm.so.6
\end{fdoccode}

Threading library (pthread\index{pthread}) is used by QtCore on Linux. LibGL\index{libGL} is 3D graphics library. LibGL is unused because no OpenGL-related\index{OpenGL} function was explicitly called in our sample application.

Number of chosen modules affects memory consumption of each executable file. So, pick a reasonable subset of available Qt modules to make your application thin and fit.

\section{Tree-like class structure}
Wisely developed library has smart class structure which makes that library easily maintainable and expandable. \textit{Class inheritance}\index{class inheritance} is used very extensively if library design is something we need to deal with. Read \citep[p.~708-783]{prata:cprimer} to get more familiar with \cpp class inheritance if you are not so far. Class inheritance says that if one class is inheritor of another class, then it inherits parent's \textit{data} and \textit{methods}.

It's good habit to have some properties available in all classes of the library. Such a property could be \eg \textit{id}, the textual (or perhaps numerical) identification of each object (instantiated class) within the library. You would have to define what \textit{id} means in each and every of your classes manually without inheritance usage. With inheritance, everything you must do, is to define \textit{id} in exactly one of your classes, promoting this class to \textit{root} class and make the rest of classes to inherit the new \textit{library base class}.

This approach is solid base for having library with the tree-like structure (see \autoref{figure:library}) where classes are structured according to their natural relationship.

So, as we found out, there is exactly one class that sits above other classes, which share its data and methods. Qt disposes this kind of top-level class too, it's called\fdocinlinecode{cpp}{!}{QObject}.

\begin{fdocextra}
Many well-known libraries follow root class idea and tree-like class structure. One example is .NET Framework. Its base class is called\fdocinlinecode{csharp}{!}{System.Object} and provides some basic functionality (shared by all .NET classes via class inheritance) such as method providing basic string representation of each object. You can find more about .NET base class in \citep[p.~84]{nigel:csharp}. Java follows very similar class hierarchy ideas.
